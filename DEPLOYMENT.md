# 🚀 Deploying Lapor Parkir to GitHub Pages

Your app has been successfully deployed! 🎉

## 📍 **Live Demo**

Your app is now available at: **https://krocified.github.io/lapor-parkir**

## 🔧 **Quick Deploy Commands**

### Option 1: Using the Deploy Script

```bash
# Deploy with the automated script
npm run deploy
```

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

```bash
# Build the web version
npm run build:web

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
git add dist/ -f
git commit -m "Update build for deployment"
git push origin main
git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages
```

## 📋 **Deployment Process**

1. **Build**: The `expo export --platform web` command creates optimized web files in the `dist/` folder
2. **Commit**: The build files are added to git (forced since dist is in .gitignore)
3. **Deploy**: The `dist/` folder is pushed to the `gh-pages` branch using git subtree
4. **Live**: GitHub Pages automatically serves the content from the `gh-pages` branch

1. Go to your repository settings on GitHub
2. Navigate to "Pages" section
